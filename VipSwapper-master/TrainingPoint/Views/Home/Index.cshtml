                TrainingPoint is a multi-tenant web application. To enable customers to sign-in using their on-premises Active Directory accounts
                or their Office 365 accounts, TrainingPoint uses Azure Active Directory as the identity provider.

        <h2>Application Roles</h2>
        <p>
            <small>

                TrainingPoint uses Azure AD application roles for role-based access control. It declares two application roles: 'Trainer' and 'Trainee'.
                Azure AD Users and Groups are assigned to these roles by the admin and when they sign-in to the application, the 'roles' claim in the token
                contatains the application role(s) that have been assigned to them.

        <h2>Groups Claim</h2>

        <p>
            <small>
                TrainingPoint allows users (in the 'Trainer' role) to share the trainings they create with Active Directory groups.
                TrainingPoint uses the Groups Claim feature of Azure AD to determine what AD groups the users is member of, then it allows
                the user to see the trainings that have been shared with those groups.
